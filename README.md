# SY Personal Website Sources

A repo for my own small hub website (can't say that it
is in active development, but I hope to start it someday).

## Redesign TODOs

- Set up a design system (SASS/CSS framework)
- Set up ShadCN and/or Radix UI components.
- Set up Meta component (for SEO and such).
- Add public artifacts.
   - Robots TXT.
- Reach 100 scores from Lighthouse.
- Set up Blog (collections layouts).
- Set up Embedded Videos Page.
- Set up Music Player + Tracks "hosting/storage".

## Dev Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. (Optional but recommended) Set node version (e.g. `nvm install && nvm use`).
3. Install dependencies with `npm ci`. 
4. Lauch local dev version with: `npm run dev`.
